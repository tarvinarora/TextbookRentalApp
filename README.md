## Description: Textbook Rental Application - TextXChange

My personal project is a textbook rental application designed specifically for students at UBC. This application facilitates access to textbooks between UBC students, offering both *rental opportunities* and *listings*. Users can either rent out their textbooks to fellow students or find textbooks available for rent. Textbooks are categorized by *Year Level, Subject, Course, and Faculty* to streamline search processes.

The primary users of this application are UBC **undergraduate** and **graduate** students. The **'Borrow a Book'** interface features a category-based navigation system and a search function that enables students to locate textbooks by author, course, or keywords. On the **'Rent a Book'** interface, students can provide details about textbooks they wish to list for rent and create new listings or manage other listings. This project is personally significant to me due to my experience as a UBC student, where the high-cost of textbooks made students hesitate to "purchase" them. So, while this approach to rent textbooks for a smaller fee is not only *affordable*, it also promotes a *sustainability* in our use of physical resources.
